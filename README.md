# haruna
the Simple Examination Service (for TECH::CAMP)

## Project Map

#### What is haruna?
  haruna is the Simple Examination Service. You can create and take exam at here. In addition, answerer's name will add to the Slack's channel topic automatically when answer posted.

#### Why I made haruna?
  The firm which I intern to provides weekly test for the interns. Though it is fruitful, too much cost for everybody. haruna will reduce great deal of cost of creating and taking test at TECH::CAMP.

#### The Profit
  So, why you use haruna?

  Answerer
    step 1: check out the test at qiita
    step 2: answer the question at goole.drive
    (why the test page and answer page have got separated !!!???)
    step 3: change the channel topic of "weekly_test" channel (add answerer's name)
