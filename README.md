the Simple Examination Service (for TECH::CAMP)

## What is haruna?
  haruna is the Simple Examination Service. You can create and take exam at here. In addition, answerer's name will add to the Slack's channel topic automatically when answer posted.

## Why I made haruna?
  The firm which I joining as a intern provides weekly test for the interns. Though it is fruitful, too much costs for everybody. haruna will reduce great deal of costs of creating and taking test at TECH::CAMP.

## The Profit
  So, why you use haruna?

  now
  ```

    step 2: create answer page at google.drive

  Answerer
    step 1: check out the test at qiita
    step 2: answer the questions at goole.drive
    (why the test page and answer page have got separated !!!???)
    step 3: change the channel topic of "weekly_test" channel (add answerer's name)
    (this step is the most frustrated moment for me..)
